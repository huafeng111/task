The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction\ninvolving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with\nrespect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the Federal Arbitration\nAct (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, \"FAA\") governs the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the Binding Arbitration provision below and\npreempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest\nextent permitted by applicable law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any\nissue that arises from or relates to the Binding Arbitration provision, then\nthat issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S. state\nwhere you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in\nwriting by the parties. The application of the United Nations Convention on\nContracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree\nto submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state\ncourts located in Santa Clara County, California, for any actions for which we\nretain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,\nmisappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property\nrights, or other proprietary rights, as set forth in the Binding Arbitration\nprovision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent\nirreparable harm. You agree that the Santa Clara County, California is the\nproper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award, or for\ntrial court proceedings in the event that the Binding Arbitration provision\nbelow is found to be unenforceable.\n\nIf there is a conflict between the English and any non-English versions of\nthese Terms, you and NVIDIA agree that the English version of these Terms will\ngovern to the extent not prohibited by local law in your jurisdiction.\n\n**_Informal Resolution_**\n\nIf you or NVIDIA have any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or\nrelating to the Site or these Terms (\"Dispute\"), we each agree to work in good\nfaith to resolve the Dispute informally. If you have a Dispute, you must first\ncontact NVIDIA and give NVIDIA an opportunity to resolve it by contacting\nNVIDIA by mail at NVIDIA Corporation, ATTN: Legal, 2788 San Tomas Expressway,\nSanta Clara, California, 95051. Either you or NVIDIA may seek to have a\nDispute resolved in small claims court if all the requirements of the small\nclaims court are satisfied. Either you or NVIDIA may seek to have a Dispute\nresolved in small claims court in your county of residence or the small claims\ncourt in closest proximity to your residence at any time before an arbitrator\nis appointed, and you may also bring a Dispute in small claims court in the\nSuperior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.\n\n**_Binding Arbitration_**\n\nYou and NVIDIA agree all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered\nby the office of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) under\nits Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect for JAMS. If\nthe amount of the Dispute is less than $10,000, then JAMS’ Optional Expedited\nArbitration Rules and Procedures will apply. The dispute (including whether\nthe claims asserted are arbitrable) will be referred to and finally determined\nby arbitration in accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules. If\nthere is any conflict between this section and any procedural or other rules\nissued by the administrator, this section will control. Except as required by\napplicable law or court order, you and NVIDIA agree to maintain\nconfidentiality (and request the arbitrator to maintain confidentiality) of\nall aspects and outcomes of the arbitration, except a party may disclose\ninformation regarding the arbitration to (i) enforce this clause or an\narbitration award or (ii) seek provisional remedies from a court of competent\njurisdiction. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of\ndecision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award\nis based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator\nwill not have authority to award damages greater than the amount, or other\nthan the types, allowed by this Agreement. Judgment on the award of the\narbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. You and\nNVIDIA agree the arbitration award will be final and binding without appeal or\nreview except as permitted by governing law. The arbitration proceedings will\ntake place in Santa Clara County, California and be conducted in English. You\nand NVIDIA agree nothing in this section will limit the right of either party\nto apply for injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief\nin any jurisdiction.\n\nIf this arbitration provision is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful,\nin whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole\nor in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or\nunlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining\nprovisions of the arbitration provision, which shall remain in force, or the\nparties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an\nindividual basis pursuant to the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nif the Class Action, Representative Action & Jury Trial Waiver below is found\nto be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would\nprevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding\nthe entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from\narbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.\nAll other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this arbitration\nprovision shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that\nlitigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive\nrelief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in\narbitration.\n\n**_Class Action, Representative Action & Jury Trial Waiver_**\n\nWITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE\nOBTAINED OR USED THE SITE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL\nDISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A\nPLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION,\nPRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS\nWAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS NVIDIA AGREES OTHERWISE, THE\nARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S DISPUTES. YOU AND NVIDIA\nAGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND\nONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE(S). ANY\nRELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. YOU AND NVIDIA AGREE THAT, BY\nENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND NVIDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A\nTRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE\nATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.\n\n**_Right to Opt-Out_**\n\nYou may opt-out of the foregoing jury trial, class action, arbitration, and\ncollective or consolidated proceeding waiver provisions by notifying NVIDIA in\nwriting within 30 days of commencement of use of the Site or within 30 days of\nany future change NVIDIA may make to the arbitration provisions in these\nTerms. Such written notification must be sent by mail to NVIDIA Corporation,\nAttn: Legal, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California, 95051 and\nmust include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) the reference to NVIDIA’s\nwebsite as the service to which the notice relates, and (4) a clear statement\nindicating that you do not wish to resolve disputes through arbitration and\ndemonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt-out. Any opt-out\nnotification received after the opt-out deadline or not including the required\nitems noted in (1)-(4) in the preceding sentence will not be valid and you\nwill be required to pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.\nOpting out of this dispute resolution procedure will not affect the terms and\nconditions of these Terms, which still apply to you. If you opt-out of any\nfuture change NVIDIA may make to the arbitration provisions in these Terms,\nthe most recent version of such change before the change you rejected will\napply.\n\n### Compliance\n\nThis Site is controlled by NVIDIA from its offices within the United States of\nAmerica.
