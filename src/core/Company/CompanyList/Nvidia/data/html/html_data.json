Our work in AI and digital twins is transforming the world's largest\nindustries and profoundly impacting society.\n\nExplore\n\n## The iPhone Moment for AI\n\nAccelerated computing and AI have fully arrived. The acceleration of deep\nlearning ignited the Big Bang of AI.  \nNow, generative AI is a new computing platform, like the PC, internet, and\nmobile-cloud.\n\nCredit: Runway AI, Adobe, Tabnine, WPP\n\n## NVIDIA is the Engine of AI\n\nNVIDIA engineers the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI\nfactories of the future. We build new AI services that help companies create\ntheir own AI factories.\n\n## Reinventing Modern Graphics\n\nNVIDIA RTX™ taps into AI and ray tracing to deliver a whole new level of\nrealism in graphics. This year, we introduced the next breakthrough in AI-\npowered graphics: DLSS 3.\n\n## Connecting Our Physical and Digital Worlds\n\nOmniverse, our platform for industrial digitalization, enables industries\ngrounded in physical processes to become software-defined and connect large,\nhighly skilled teams.\n\n## Driving Automotive Growth\n\nGenerative AI and digitalization are reshaping the $3 trillion automotive\nindustry, from design and engineering to manufacturing, autonomous driving,\nand customer experience. NVIDIA is at the epicenter of this industrial\ntransformation.\n\nCredit: WPP, McLaren; Koenigsegg; BMW; Rimac\n\n## Supercharging Healthcare\n\nWith NVIDIA, healthcare institutions can harness the power of AI and high-\nperformance computing to define the future of medicine.\n\n## Accelerated Computing Is Sustainable Computing\n\nData centers are already about 1-2% of global electricity consumption and\ngrowing. This is not sustainable for operating budgets and our planet.\nAcceleration is the best way to reclaim power and achieve sustainability and\nnet zero.\n\n## Like No Place You’ve Ever Worked\n\n“NVIDIA is reshaping the future of computing. We’ve built a culture where\npeople can do their life's work. We are a learning machine. The mission is\nboss. Everyone has a voice.” — Jensen Huang\n\nSee Careers\n\n![Image 1](https://images.nvidia.com/nv-story-tool/nv-\nstory-09132023/assets/about-nvidia/history-ari.jpg)\n\nHistory\n\nA timeline of innovation\n\n![Image 2](https://images.nvidia.com/nv-story-tool/nv-\nstory-09132023/assets/about-nvidia/investors-ari.jpg)\n\nInvestors\n\nQuarterly and historical results, resources\n\n![Image 3](https://images.nvidia.com/nv-story-tool/nv-\nstory-09132023/assets/about-nvidia/newsroom-ari.jpg)\n\nNewsroom\n\nThe latest NVIDIA news\n\n![Image 4](https://images.nvidia.com/nv-story-tool/nv-\nstory-09132023/assets/about-nvidia/careers-ari.jpg)\n\nCareers\n\nJoin our team\n\nclose\n\n![](https://www.nvidia.com/akam/13/pixel_7eb67bdf?a=dD0zOTE2MDc4OWIyYzYzZjczZTIxODUxNmE3ZTIwZDRjMDlhMGM5YjE1JmpzPW9mZg==)\n\n"

A live webcast\n(listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA's\ninvestor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be\nrecorded and available for replay until NVIDIA's conference call to discuss\nits financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**  \nTo supplement NVIDIA's condensed consolidated financial statements presented\nin accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain\ncomponents of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP\ngross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP\nincome from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net\nincome, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash\nflow. For NVIDIA's investors to be better able to compare its current results\nwith those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP\nto non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP\nfinancial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-\nrelated and other costs, other, gains from non-affiliated investments and\npublicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization\nof debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where\napplicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by\noperating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and\nintangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and\nintangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial\nmeasures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's historical\nfinancial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial\nmeasures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the\ncompany's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the\ncompany's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by\nother companies.\n\n**NVIDIA CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME**  \n(In
